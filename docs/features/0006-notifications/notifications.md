# Notifications

This backlog captures cross-page reminder and notification UX, starting with late calendar items.

## Goal
Help users notice and resolve overdue work quickly from anywhere in the app, without forcing them to manually scan Calendar views.

## Scope For This Iteration
- Global late-items reminder visible across authenticated tabs.
- Late-items bottom sheet optimized for fast triage.
- Quick completion flow with duration confirmation.
- Route-driven refresh policy for notification freshness.
- Navigation from reminder entries to targeted Calendar context.
- Dedicated test coverage for reminder behaviors.

## Out Of Scope For This Iteration
- Browser push notifications.
- Email or external notification channels.
- Non-calendar notification types (for example due-soon, admin events, checklist reminders).

## Backend Contract Input
- Existing calendar list endpoint: `GET /api/v1/calendar-items`.
- Existing completion path: status update through `POST /api/v1/calendar-items`.

## Recommended Delivery Order
1. `001` Global late-items reminder surface.
2. `002` Late-items sheet interactions and navigation to Calendar actions.
3. `003` Quick complete flow with prefilled duration prompt.
4. `004` Route-change refresh and state coherence.
5. `005` Notification reminder test coverage matrix.
