# Calendar Mobile UX

This backlog captures the mobile UX issues observed on the calendar, with Day view as the first implementation target.

## Goal
Improve the mobile calendar experience so the most useful actions and information are visible, understandable, and easy to operate on a touch device.

## Stories

### To Refine
- [005 Creation Entrypoint](to-refine/005-creation-entrypoint.md) - Rework the mobile creation CTA so it helps without obscuring content.
- [007 Touch Accessibility](to-refine/007-touch-accessibility.md) - Ensure controls and timeline interactions remain usable with touch constraints.
- [008 Top Area Density](to-refine/008-top-area-density.md) - Reduce calendar-owned vertical chrome so meaningful content appears sooner on mobile.
- [009 Mobile View Navigation](to-refine/009-mobile-view-navigation.md) - Rework mobile view switching and direct date access into a more compact navigation model.

### DONE
- [004A Mobile Overlap Stack](done/004a-mobile-overlap-stack.md) - Replace mobile overlap columns with a readable stacked deck.
- [004B Hidden Cards Show End Position](done/004b-hidden-cards-show-end-position.md) - Keep lower cards partially visible so their end positions remain understandable.
- [004C Overlap Bottom Sheet](done/004c-overlap-bottom-sheet.md) - Let mobile users inspect all items in a dense overlap group.
- [004D Promote Hidden Item](done/004d-promote-hidden-item.md) - Let users bring a hidden overlap item to the top card for action.
- [002 Initial Focus](done/002-initial-focus.md) - Bring the user directly to the most relevant part of the day when the screen opens.
- [003 Date Context](done/003-date-context.md) - Make the visible date easier to understand at a glance on mobile.

## Canceled Stories
- [001 Header Compaction](canceled/001-header-compaction.md) - Replaced by more focused stories covering top-area density, mobile view navigation, and mobile secondary actions.
- [004 Overlap Readability](canceled/004-overlap-readability.md) - Split into focused INVEST stories for mobile overlap rendering and interaction.
- [006 Mobile Actions Sheet](canceled/006-mobile-actions-sheet.md) - Not useful anymore after cleanup.
